  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>3 cups elbow macaroni</li>
    <li>Â½ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>1 cup of Colby and Monterey Jack cheese</li>
    <li>6-8 oz Velveeta cheese</li>
    <li>1 cup sharp cheddar</li>
    <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup smoked cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>Paprika</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 F.</li>
    <li>Cook macaroni until just al dente or a little under al dente. (Look on the back of the box to see how long you
      need to cook your pasta for it to reach al dente.) Be careful not to overcook.</li>
    <li>Drain pasta and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, add milk, heavy cream and cheeses (except for the smoked cheddar).</li>
    <li>Stir to combine.</li>
    <li>Taste the milk mixture and add salt and pepper until it has a good taste. (You can also add in other seasonings
      like onion powder, paprika, etc. Tasting will help avoid having a plain, bland baked macaroni and cheese.)</li>
    <li>When you are content with the taste, add the eggs.
    </li>
    <li>Stir well until combined.</li>
    <li>Butter a 9 x 9-inch baking dish.</li>
    <li>Add macaroni to the baking dish.</li>
    <li>Pour cheese mixture over macaroni.</li>
    <li>Make sure the cheese is distributed well.</li>
    <li>Top with the smoked cheddar cheese. (I add a little more Colby jack as well.) Sprinkle with paprika and/or black
      pepper, if desired.</li>
    <li>Bake for 35-45 minutes. Do not overbake. It may be a bit jiggly when you take it out of the oven. It will firm
      up as it cool.</li>
    <li>Let cool for about 10-15 minutes or until fully set.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
